I bought this bicycle at a bicycle shop on Hackey road.

I guess its name was like 'your bicycle shop,' but I think it's permanently closed or moved to another place.
I think it will be fine for a person with 165~175cm.

The original price was  [GBP 245]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/bicycle/bicycle.pdf) on September 27th 2021, but I would like to sell it for GBP 50 (GBP 30 for a resident of Claredale house).
Helmet and lock are free.

I had used it from last September to last weak.
It seems fine, but you might visit a repair shop just in case, especially if you want to adjust the seat height.

If you are interested, please leave comments below or directly conntact me if you have my number.
