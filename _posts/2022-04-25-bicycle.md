I bought this bicycle at a bicycle shop on Hackey road.

I guess its name was like 'your bicycle shop,' but I think it's permanently closed or moved to another place.
I think it will be fine for a person with 165~175cm.

The original price was  [GBP 245](assets/bicycle/bicycle.pdf) on September 27th 2021, but I would like to sell it for GBP 50 (GBP 30 for a resident of Claredale house).

I had used it from last September to last weak.
It seems fine, but you might visit a repair shop just in case, especially if you want to adjust the seat height.
